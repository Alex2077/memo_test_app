What is Apache Kafka?;Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.
Who originally developed Kafka?;Kafka was originally developed by LinkedIn and later open-sourced as an Apache project.
What are the main components of Kafka?;The main components are Producers, Brokers, Consumers, Topics, Partitions, and ZooKeeper (for older versions).
What is a Kafka Topic?;A topic is a category or feed name to which records (messages) are published by producers.
What are Partitions in Kafka?;Partitions are subsets of a topic that allow Kafka to parallelize and distribute data across multiple brokers.
What is a Kafka Broker?;A broker is a Kafka server that stores data and serves client requests (producers and consumers).
What is a Kafka Producer?;A producer is a client application that publishes (writes) messages to Kafka topics.
What is a Kafka Consumer?;A consumer is a client application that reads and processes messages from Kafka topics.
What is a Consumer Group in Kafka?;A consumer group consists of multiple consumers that work together to consume messages from a topic, dividing partitions among themselves.
What is ZooKeeper's role in Kafka?;ZooKeeper manages Kafka brokers, leader election, and cluster metadata (though newer versions are moving away from ZooKeeper).
What is Kafka Streams?;Kafka Streams is a client library for building real-time stream processing applications using Kafka.
What is Kafka Connect?;Kafka Connect is a framework for integrating Kafka with external systems like databases and storage systems.
What is the role of an Offset in Kafka?;An offset is a unique identifier for a message within a partition, allowing consumers to track their position.
What is Kafka's retention policy?;Kafka retains messages for a configurable period (time-based) or until a certain size is reached (size-based).
What is a Replica in Kafka?;A replica is a copy of a partition stored on another broker for fault tolerance.
What is the difference between a Leader and Follower replica?;The leader handles all read/write requests for a partition, while followers replicate data for backup.
What is ISR in Kafka?;ISR (In-Sync Replicas) is the set of replicas (leader + followers) that are fully caught up with the leader.
What is the purpose of Kafka's log compaction?;Log compaction ensures that Kafka retains only the latest value for each key in a topic, useful for stateful applications.
What is a Kafka Cluster?;A Kafka cluster is a group of brokers working together to provide scalability and fault tolerance.
What is the default port for Kafka brokers?;The default port is 9092.
What is the difference between Kafka and RabbitMQ?;Kafka is designed for high-throughput, distributed event streaming, while RabbitMQ is a traditional message broker with queues.
What is a Kafka Controller?;The controller is a broker responsible for managing partition leadership and broker failures.
How does Kafka ensure fault tolerance?;Through replication, leader-follower architecture, and ISR (In-Sync Replicas).
What is the role of `acks` in Kafka Producers?;`acks` (acknowledgments) determine how many replicas must acknowledge a write before it's considered successful (`acks=0`, `1`, or `all`).
What is Kafka MirrorMaker?;MirrorMaker is a tool for replicating data between two Kafka clusters (e.g., for geo-redundancy).
What is the difference between `at-least-once` and `exactly-once` semantics in Kafka?;`At-least-once` ensures no data loss but may have duplicates; `exactly-once` ensures each message is processed once.
What is Schema Registry in Kafka?;Schema Registry manages Avro schemas for Kafka messages, ensuring compatibility between producers and consumers.
How does Kafka handle high throughput?;Through partitioning, batching, sequential I/O, and zero-copy optimizations.
What is a Kafka Transaction?;Kafka transactions allow atomic writes across multiple partitions and topics.
What is the purpose of `auto.offset.reset` in Kafka Consumers?;It defines what to do when no offset is found (`earliest`, `latest`, or `none`).
What is a Kafka ACL?;ACLs (Access Control Lists) restrict access to Kafka resources (topics, clusters) based on users/roles.
What is the role of `group.id` in Kafka Consumers?;It identifies the consumer group to which a consumer belongs.
What is the difference between `compact` and `delete` topic cleanup policies?;`delete` removes old segments based on retention; `compact` keeps the latest value for each key.
What is Kafka's max.message.bytes?;It defines the maximum size (in bytes) of a message that Kafka can accept.
What is a Headless Consumer in Kafka?;A consumer that does not belong to any consumer group (rarely used).
What is the purpose of `min.insync.replicas`?;It sets the minimum number of replicas that must acknowledge a write for it to succeed.
What is the role of `linger.ms` in Kafka Producers?;It delays sending messages to allow batching, improving throughput.
What is a Kafka REST Proxy?;A proxy that allows interaction with Kafka via HTTP instead of the native protocol.
What is the purpose of `unclean.leader.election.enable`?;If `true`, Kafka can elect a non-ISR replica as leader (risky for data consistency).
What is the difference between Kafka and Pulsar?;Kafka is a mature event streaming platform, while Pulsar offers multi-tenancy, tiered storage, and built-in functions.
